# C Programming Fundamentals - Semester 1

This repository contains all the lab assignments and practical programs for my **C Programming** course. These programs reflect my hands-on practice and understanding of core logic and mathematical algorithms.

All programs are implemented in **C**, following structured coding practices.

## 📂 Folder Structure

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `prime_check.c` | Determines if a number is prime using iterative loops. |
| `greatest_of_three.c` | Logic to find the largest among three numbers using nested if-else. |
| `fibonacci.c` | Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to 'n' terms. |
| `factorial.c` | Calculates the factorial of a given integer using for-loops. |

## 🚀 How to Run
You can use any standard C compiler (GCC) to run these programs. For example:
```bash
gcc greatest_of_three.c -o output
./output
