## <h1>​💻 C Programming: Logic & Fundamentals</h1>
​This repository documents my progress in learning C, focusing on building a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and structured code.

## <h2>​🛠️ Technical Highlights</h2>
​Algorithmic Logic: Basic implementations of prime checking, Fibonacci sequences, and mathematical factorials.<br>
​Control Flow: Practical use of loops and conditional branching (if-else) to solve logic-based problems.<br>
​Code Organization: A focus on maintaining readable syntax and consistent code structures.<br>

## <h2>📂 Folder Structure</h2>

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `prime_check.c` | Determines if a number is prime using iterative loops. |
| `greatest_of_three.c` | Logic to find the largest among three numbers using nested if-else. |
| `fibonacci.c` | Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to 'n' terms. |
| `factorial.c` | Calculates the factorial of a given integer using for-loops. |
| `reward_system.c` | Calculates student prize money based on Science and Maths marks. |
| `triangle_identifier.c` | Determines if a triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Right-angled. |

## <h2> 🚀 How to Run </h2>
You can use any standard C compiler (GCC) to run these programs. For example:
```bash
gcc greatest_of_three.c -o output
./output
